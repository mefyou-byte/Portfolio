            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Matiou Faltas </span>
            from <span className="purple">Graz, Austria.</span>
            <br />I'm a Software Engineer from Graz, Austria. I graduated 2019 from the Higher
            Technical College Graz-GÃ¶sting of Electronics & Technical Computer Science and got my Diploma. Creating, maintain, audit and improve systems in particular need is the role i have. 
            Such as desigining and writing some cool Code for dynamic applications, is my passion.
            <br />
            <br />
            After my 5-year journey at college, I have built a solid foundation 
            of computer science. In order to continue my education in computer
            science and also to acquire economic skills, I decided in 2020 to start a bachelor's degree in Business Informatics at FH CAMPUS 02. 
            I work as a software engineer for DCCS IT Business Solution.

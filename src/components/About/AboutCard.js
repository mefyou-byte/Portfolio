            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Matiou Faltas </span>

            Technical College Graz-GÃ¶sting </span> of Electronics & Technical Computer Science and got my Diploma. Creating, maintain, audit and improve systems in particular need is the role i have.

            After my 5-year journey at college, I have built a solid foundation 
            of computer science. In order to continue my education in computer
            science and also to acquire economic skills, I decided in <span className="purple">2020</span> to start a <span className="purple">bachelor's degree in Business Informatics</span> at FH CAMPUS 02.
